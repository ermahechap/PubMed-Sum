## Notebooks
The project comprises 3 notebooks:
1. **xml_data_preprocessing.ipynb:** Used to connect wit OA/OAI PubMed API. It also performs a basic XML preprocessing to remove the parts of the articles that are not relevant for text analysis such as diagrams, pictures, etc.
2. **litcovid_data_preprocessing.ipynb:** Similar to the notebook above, but instead it process the text database provided by PubMed regarding the COVID-19 emergency (LitCovid).
3. **summarization.ipynb:** Performs summarization using the Google T5 model available in HugginFace.

## Additional Documents
We provide a paper (which is more like a technical document that summarizes the project scope) and a set of slides. Both are in spanish.
